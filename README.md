Hello everyone! I've created a Reaction Game based on the micro:bit Foundation's Home Learning Reaction Game.
[https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/reaction-game/](https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/reaction-game/)

I hope you like it, if you have any suggestions or issues, you can email dillonbarnesmicrobit@gmail.com OR create an issue/pull request here in GitHub.

To play this game you will need four crocodile clips, some foil and some cardboard, as well as your micro:bit of course!
Use this page and the image to help set up, just use this improved program instead!
