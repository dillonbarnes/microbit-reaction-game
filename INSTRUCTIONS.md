# hit:bit

Here are instructions on how to create your hit:bit. If you have a speaker/buzzer/headphones you can connect it to your micro:bit with two extra crocodile clips. Connect it to P0 and GND on the micro:bit.

## You need

* 4 Crocodile clips (Double ended. Each wire with two clips on is referred to as a single crocodile clip.)
* 2 Pieces of cardboard
* 4 Pieces of foil
* 1 BBC micro:bt
* 1 Device that you can use to download code to you micro:bit
* Glue ( I used PVA, but you can use whatever you have)

## Setup

1. Using glue, attach two pieces of foil onto each piece of carboard. These are your controllers. Write P1 on the first, and P2 on the other.
2. Using  bluetooth, or a Type-B Mini-USB cable, download the hit:bit program onto your micro:bit.
[https://bit.ly/mbhitbit/](https://bit.ly/mbhitbit) This can be done later, but I recommend doing it now, so that you don't have a lot of trouuble moving the micro:bit to connect it to your device.
3. Get your first controller (P1) and two crocodile clips. Put one crocodile clip on the first foil piece, and the other end on P1 on the micro:bit. Then, put one end of the other crocodile clip on the second foil piece and the other end on GND.
4. Repeat Step 3 with the second controller(P2) but put the first clip onto P2 on the micro:bit.
5. Grab a partner, and move to the next section.

## Let's Play!

1. Turn on the micro:bit. (Many people wonder why projects aren't working, because they forget to turn their micro:bit on!)
2. Give your partner the second controller and make sure you can both see the screen on the micro:bit.
3. Select the amount of rounds you want to play. use A to go up by one and B to go down by one.
4. When you're ready to start press A and B at the same time.
5. Hit both of your foil pieces when the heart appears before the other player does. If a 1 appears on the screen, P1 won the round. If it's a 2, it's P2.
6. To see your scores again once the game has finished, press A to view P1's or B to see P2's.
7. Want a rematch? Press A and B together to restart. Remember that scores ARE NOT reset. To reset scores, press the reset button on the back of the micro:bit.
